Compat Inspector is designed to help sites migrating to IE10 Standards Mode, not those running in legacy modes.
== Description ==
Compat Inspector is a JavaScript-based testing tool that analyzes your site while it runs. Compat Inspector reports patterns of interaction which cause issues in recent modes. This allows you to identify problems quickly without memorizing a bunch of documentation or searching through the entirety of your site's code. We developed Compat Inspector during the course of IE9 to speed up the process of recognizing common issues across different sites and have now updated it for IE10. Along the way, many members of the IE team contributed to the set of test cases that make up the rules in Compat Inspector.
